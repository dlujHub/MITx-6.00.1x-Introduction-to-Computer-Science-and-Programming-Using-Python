"""McDonaldâ€™s sells Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 or 20 McNuggets. Thus, it is possible, for example,
to buy exactly 15 McNuggets (with one package of 6 and a second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly
16 McNuggets, since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16. To determine if it is
possible to buy exactly n McNuggets, one has to find non-negative integer (can be 0) values of a, b, and c such that

Write a function, called McNuggets that takes one argument, n, and returns True if it is possible to buy a
combination of 6, 9 and 20 pack units such that the total number of McNuggets equals n, and otherwise returns False.
Hint: use a guess and check approach. """
