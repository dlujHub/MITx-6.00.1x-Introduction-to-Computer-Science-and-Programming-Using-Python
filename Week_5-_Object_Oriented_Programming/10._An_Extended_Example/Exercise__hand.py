# Exercise: hand
# 5/5 points (graded)
# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 14 minutes

# In this problem, you'll be asked to read through an object-oriented implementation of the hand from the word game problem of Problem
# Set 4. You'll then be asked to implement one of its methods. Note that the implementation of the object-oriented version of the hand
# is a bit different than how we did things with the functional implementation; pay close attention to doc strings and read through the
# implementation carefully.

# To begin: Download hand.py and read through the file. Be sure to understand what's going on in the file. Make a few instances of the
# Hand class, and play around with the existing methods.

# When you have completed reading through the file, implement the update method.

# Paste the entire Hand class in the box below.
