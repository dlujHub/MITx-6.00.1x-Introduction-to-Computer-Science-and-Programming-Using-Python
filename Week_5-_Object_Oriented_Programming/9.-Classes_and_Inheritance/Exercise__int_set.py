# Exercise: int set
# 5/5 points (graded)
# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 10 minutes

# Consider the following code from the last lecture video:

# Your task is to define the following two methods for the intSet class:
#   1. Define an intersect method that returns a new intSet containing elements that appear in both sets. In other words,
#      s1.intersect(s2)
#      would return a new intSet of integers that appear in both s1 and s2. Think carefully - what should happen if s1 and s2 have no
#      elements in common?

#   2. Add the appropriate method(s) so that len(s) returns the number of elements in s.

# Hint: look through the Python docs to figure out what you'll need to solve this problem.
