# Exercise: iter power

# (5/5 points)
# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 6 minutes

# Write an iterative function iterPower(base, exp) that calculates the exponential baseexp by simply using successive multiplication.
# For example, iterPower(base, exp) should compute baseexp by multiplying base times itself exp times. Write such a function below.

# This function should take in two values - base can be a float or an integer; exp will be an integer â‰¥ 0. It should return one numerical
# value. Your code must be iterative - use of the ** operator is not allowed.


def iterPower(base, exp):
    '''
    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0

    returns: int or float, base^exp
    '''
    if exp == 0:
        return 1
    result = base
    while exp>1:
        result *= base
        exp -= 1
    return result
