# Exercise: gcd recur

# (5/5 points)
# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 6 minutes

# The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder. For example,
# gcd(2, 12) = 2
# gcd(6, 12) = 6
# gcd(9, 12) = 3
# gcd(17, 12) = 1

# A clever mathematical trick (due to Euclid) makes it easy to find greatest common divisors. Suppose that a and b are two positive
# integers:
# If b = 0, then the answer is a
# Otherwise, gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(b, a % b)

# Write a function gcdRecur(a, b) that implements this idea recursively. This function takes in two positive integers and returns one
# integer.


def gcdRecur(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers

    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcdRecur(b, a % b)
