# Problem 3 - Using Bisection Search to Make the Program Faster

# (20/20 points)
# You'll notice that in Problem 2, your monthly payment had to be a multiple of $10. Why did we make it that way? You can try running
# your code locally so that the payment can be any dollar and cent amount (in other words, the monthly payment is a multiple of $0.01).
# Does your code still work? It should, but you may notice that your code runs more slowly, especially in cases with very large balances
# and interest rates. (Note: when your code is running on our servers, there are limits on the amount of computing time each submission
# is allowed, so your observations from running this experiment on the grading system might be limited to an error message complaining
# about too much time taken.)

# Well then, how can we calculate a more accurate fixed monthly payment than we did in Problem 2 without running into the problem of slow
# code?
# We can make this program run faster using a technique introduced in lecture - bisection search!

# The following variables contain values as described below:
# balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
# annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

# To recap the problem: we are searching for the smallest monthly payment such that we can pay off the entire balance within a year. What
# is a reasonable lower bound for this payment value? $0 is the obvious anwer, but you can do better than that. If there was no interest,
# the debt can be paid off by monthly payments of one-twelfth of the original balance, so we must pay at least this much every month.
# One-twelfth of the original balance is a good lower bound.

# What is a good upper bound? Imagine that instead of paying monthly, we paid off the entire balance at the end of the year. What we
# ultimately pay must be greater than what we would've paid in monthly installments, because the interest was compounded on the balance
# we didn't pay off each month. So a good upper bound for the monthly payment would be one-twelfth of the balance, after having its
# interest compounded monthly for an entire year.

# In short:
# Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
# Monthly payment lower bound = Balance / 12
# Monthly payment upper bound = (Balance x (1 + Monthly interest rate)12) / 12.0

# Write a program that uses these bounds and bisection search (for more info check out the Wikipedia page on bisection search) to find
# the smallest monthly payment to the cent (no more multiples of $10) such that we can pay off the debt within a year. Try it out with
# large inputs, and notice how fast it is (try the same large inputs in your solution to Problem 2 to compare!). Produce the same return
# value as you did in Problem 2.

# Note that if you do not use bisection search, your code will not run - your code only has 30 seconds to run on our servers.


init_balance = balance
monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate/12
lower = init_balance/12
upper = (init_balance * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)**12)/12.0
epsilon = 0.03

while abs(balance) > epsilon:
    monthlyPaymentRate = (upper + lower)/2
    balance = init_balance
    for i in range(12):
        balance = balance - monthlyPaymentRate + ((balance - monthlyPaymentRate) * monthlyInterestRate)
    if balance > epsilon:
        lower = monthlyPaymentRate
    elif balance < -epsilon:
        upper = monthlyPaymentRate
    else:
        break
print('Lowest Payment:', round(monthlyPaymentRate, 2))

# Correct
